Magnet2Torrent
==============

Simple javascript code for a bookmarklet that allows you to retrieve the .torrent file from The Pirate Bay, instead of getting the magnet link.

To use it, just create a bookmark in your browser and instead of typing a url for it, copy and paste the code in "magnet2torrent.js".

When browsing The Pirate Bay, while in a torrent page, just click your bookmark and you'll get the .torrent file.

This code is written to work specifically with The Pirate Bay.
